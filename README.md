# Synopsis
This project is coming from the Coursera Cleaning Data Course. It has 4 weeks of curriculum. In the 4th week, there is an assignment regarding data cleansing. This entire project is based upon the methodology of solving that assignment.

3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
